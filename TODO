Should probably do before it hits users

* currently if you get your arguments backwards, your requirements get deleted, replaced with empty dir. this is bad


Things that I want to do, but would put me past my deadline:

* coverage: 155, 208, 225, 229-231, 338, 368, 372

* On ubuntu stock python2.7 I have to rm -rf $VIRTUAL_ENV/local
    to avoid the AssertionError('unexpected third case')
    https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/340/keyerror-subpy

* I could remove the --cov-config with a small patch to pytest-cov
    use os.path.abspath(options.cov_config) in postprocess(options)

* coverage.py adds some helpful warnings to stderr, with no way to quiet them.
    there's already an issue (#2 i think?), just needs a patch

* pytest-timeout won't actually time-out with floating-point, zero, or negative input


* Make doubly sure these test scenarios are covered:
   * entirely clean -- <venv_path> does not exist
   * noop -- Requirements haven't changed since last run
   * each of these should behave similarly whether caused by the user or the requirements file:
       * upgrade
       * downgrade
       * add
       * delete

* pypy support. Some icky subprocess bugs makes it impossible to make not-flakey:

    * https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issue/1912/subprocess-deadlock-in-pypy3
